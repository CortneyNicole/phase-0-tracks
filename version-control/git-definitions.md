# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
   Version control gives us the ability to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files and merge revisions by different people.
   It is useful because it allows developers to go back and view different save points so we can more successifully identify bugs.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
   A branch maps the deviation of code from the master branch to each commit until it is merged back to the master branch.
   We use branches to modify code without jeporidizing the master. Branches also allow multiple developers to work on a project and with the same code with out getting in eachothers way.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
   A commit is a save point that records changes in code. A good commit message is discriptive and percise. 
* What is a merge conflict?
   A merge conflict is when there are competing changes on the same line of a file or if a file has been deleted that some one else is editing.

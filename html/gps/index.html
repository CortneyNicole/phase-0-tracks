<!--
* semantic tags are make the page disabled friendly and to make make your code more readable for your team. I think its more useful to have the code standerized for you deveopment team. It makes it easier to add to code yourself and to debug.

* The browser reads HTML elements from top to bottom.

* I learned how to make snippets on sublime. I will definitly be making more snippets for basic website layout an tables.

*Semantic tags were most confusing. I am going to make flash cards.

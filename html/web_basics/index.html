    <h1>My Journey to Becoimg a Developer</h1>
    <h3>By Cortney Scott</h3>
      <p>I guess you would say my journey began when I started dating my now fianc√©, Rachel. She is a senior visual and product designer and she introduced me to the world of tech. Now I am no good at design but I like taking her design and making it functional. So I started do turtorials to teach myself.<strong>Tutorials I used were:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Treehouse</li>
        <li>Codeacademy</li>
        <li>udemy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I pretty quickly realized that I wanted to pursue this as a career. I quit my job as a hairstylist and started studying non-stop while researching which school I wanted to attend.<strong>Top 3 Schools:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Dev Bootcamp</li>
        <li>Hackreactor</li>
        <li>Hackbright</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I of course chose <em>Dev Bootcamp</em> and am so excited about my future!</p>
